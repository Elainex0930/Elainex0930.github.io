# About Me
<!-- There can be a picture of mine or others -->
<!--img src="https://caihanlin.com/caihanlin.jpg" class="floatpic"-->

Here is **Elaine Xing** (also [Erllane](https://erllane.kesug.com), which derives from Erlkonig by Schubert, one of best favourate of mine).<br>

I am a graduate student in the [Center of Mathematics](http://cam.tju.edu.cn) at Tianjin University, supervised by [*Assoc. Prof.* Yaohong Wang](https://faculty.tju.edu.cn/166056/zh_CN/index.htm) (now at [Department of Mathematics](https://math.tju.edu.cn/), Tianjin University) and [*Assoc. Prof.* Baofang Song](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/teaching/all_time/11927.html) (now at [College of Engineering](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University). 


I have worked on hydrodynamic pipeflow, magnetohydrodynamics(MHD), and natural receptivity under the guidance of [*Assos. Prof.* Baofang Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0u1ZBCgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra), [*Assos. Res.* Jun Hu](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5944-5747) ([IAPCM](http://www.iapcm.ac.cn/)) and [*Prof.* Cunbiao Lee](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1552-1346) ([PKU](https://www.coe.pku.edu.cn/teaching/all_time/7151.html)). Though worked in fluids mainly, I also keen on some fields in math especially on machine learning, computational maths, PDE theory, harmonic analysis and dynamical system.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. I would like you reach out to me by 
email (elainexing0930@gmail.com). 

Apart of that, I will appreciate it if you would like to branch out my project of [Negmiewan](https://github.com/Elainex0930/Negmiewan) and contribute to it! <font color=#F08080> IF ERRORS ARE FOUND, PLEASE MAIL ME OR REACH ME ON TELEGRAM, THANK YOU! </font>

## Research Interests (temporary)

which I worked in:

- Magnetohedrodynamics (MHD, major in stability of mixed convection flow)
- Hydrodynamics (channel flow, pipe flow, diverging pipe)
- Boundary layer (receptivity)

also interested in:

- Multi-phase flow
- AI4S (AI-driven CFD)
- Meteorology (compressive fluids)
