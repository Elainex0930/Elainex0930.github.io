# Hobbies
I have not decided what to write in this page yet, yo dawg:)

I used to like hiking, cycling and play music. I have a technique in about a dozen types of instruments (erhu-Chinese fiddle, guitar-fingerstyle and acoustic, piano etc.). Once upon a time, I just showed a crazy keen interest in nyckelharpa but failed in getting one, which is somehow a type of viola yeah?


<!--This page hasn’t been updated for a long time. Over the past year, I’ve remained passionate about swimming, but the lack of convenient and decent swimming pools in Cambridge has been an inconvenience. As a result, I’ve been swimming less frequently and have gained some weight. If you’re also in Cambridge and interested in swimming, running, or hiking together, feel free to contact me!-->



<!--## Past Hobbies

I previously enjoyed long-distance running, [vlog making](https://space.bilibili.com/594030035), and computer game developing/playing. However, I have no time to do any of these things recently.-->
